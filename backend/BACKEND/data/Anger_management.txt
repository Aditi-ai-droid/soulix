Firstly; stay clam & positive for yourself


Understanding Anger:

Anger is a normal emotion—it signals that something matters to you.

Problems arise when anger is uncontrolled or expressed harmfully.


Signs You’re Getting Angry:

Clenched fists or jaw

Rapid heartbeat or tense muscles

Irritability, frustration, or shouting

Negative self-talk or blaming others


Quick Calming Techniques:

1. Pause & Breathe:

Count to 10 slowly, focusing on your breath.

Deep breaths help calm your nervous system.



2. Physical Release:

Go for a walk, punch a pillow, or do a quick stretch.

Physical activity helps release tension safely.



3. Express Safely:

Write your feelings in a journal.

Use “I feel…” statements instead of blaming others (e.g., “I feel frustrated when…”)


Long-Term Anger Management:

Identify triggers and plan coping strategies in advance.

Practice relaxation daily: meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.

Communicate calmly and assertively, not aggressively.

Seek counseling if anger affects relationships, work, or self-esteem.


Friendly Tip:
“When anger rises, give yourself a gentle pause. Breathe deeply, stretch, or write it down. Treat your emotions like a friend—you’re learning to respond, not react.” 🌊
