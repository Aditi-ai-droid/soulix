Mood Boosters
Why Mood Boosters Matter:

They give your mind a quick lift and reduce stress.

Regular small joys improve overall emotional health.


Ways to Boost Your Mood:

1. Physical Activity:

Dance to your favorite song, stretch, or go for a short walk.

Movement releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins.



2. Creative Expression:

Draw, paint, color, write, or cook something new.

Let yourself be playful‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need to be perfect.



3. Social Connection:

Call or text a friend, share a laugh, or send a positive message.

Even a small interaction can lift your spirits.



4. Mindful Fun:

Watch a funny video, listen to uplifting music, or spend time in nature.

Pay attention to the sensations‚Äîfeel the music, notice the colors, breathe deeply.



5. Gratitude Practice:

Write 3 things you are thankful for each day.

Focus on even small positive moments; they accumulate over time.
